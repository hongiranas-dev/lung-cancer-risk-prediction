## 🚨 Real-World Problem

Lung cancer is the **leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide**, primarily due to **late diagnosis**.

❌ Limited access to specialists (especially in rural areas)  
❌ High cost of CT scans and delayed screening  
❌ Symptoms ignored until advanced stages  

🧠 **Why this matters:**  
Early detection can increase survival rates from **~5% (late stage)** to **~70% (early stage)**.

This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning can assist early risk awareness**, helping doctors, organizations, and individuals identify **high-risk cases sooner**.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built a **Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression** to predict lung cancer risk based on **health and lifestyle factors** from **390 individuals**.

### 🔧 What the system does:
- 🧹 Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 📈 Risk factor visualization  
- 🤖 Lung cancer risk prediction


## 🌍 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG Alignment)

### 🏥 **SDG 3 – Good Health & Well-Being**
- Supports **early awareness & prevention**
- Encourages timely medical consultation
- Reduces late-stage cancer risks

### 🤝 **SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities**
- Low-cost, cloud-based screening approach
- Accessible in rural and underserved regions
- No expensive medical infrastructure required

### 🌱 **SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure**
- Demonstrates AI-driven healthcare innovation
- Scalable digital health solution
- Open-source and reproducible ML pipeline

📌 **Impact mindset:** AI should **support healthcare professionals**, not replace them.
